# 📊 Data Pipeline Architecture Comparison  
_Read the attached files for detailed implementation_

This summary compares three common data pipeline patterns used in production systems:

- 🔄 **Batch Processing**
- ⚡ **Event-Driven Pipelines**
- 📡 **Real-Time Streaming**

---

## 1. ⏳ Batch Pipeline

- **🛠 Use Case:** End-of-day ETL, periodic reports  
- **⏱ Latency:** 30–60 minutes  
- **📦 Throughput:** GBs/hour  
- **💰 Cost Estimate:** $300–$1,000/month  
- **✅ Pros:** Simple, reliable, and predictable  
- **⚠️ Cons:** High latency, resource spikes, no real-time view  

---

## 2. ⚙️ Event-Driven Pipeline

- **🛠 Use Case:** Order processing, inventory sync, alerts  
- **⏱ Latency:** ≤ 500 ms  
- **📦 Throughput:** Hundreds to thousands of events/second  
- **💰 Cost Estimate:** $200–$1,000/month  
- **✅ Pros:** Low latency, scalable, loosely coupled  
- **⚠️ Cons:** Requires DLQ handling, distributed debugging complexity  

---

## 3. 🚀 Real-Time Streaming

- **🛠 Use Case:** Personalized recommendations, fraud detection, live dashboards  
- **⏱ Latency:** ≤ 1 second  
- **📦 Throughput:** Tens of thousands of events/second  
- **💰 Cost Estimate:** $1,000–$2,500/month  
- **✅ Pros:** Enables real-time analytics, dynamic UIs  
- **⚠️ Cons:** High ops effort, tuning required, error propagation

## 📈 Trade-Offs & Selection Guide

| Pipeline Type     | ⏱ Latency   | 💰 Monthly Cost      | 🚀 Best Used For                              |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Batch**         | 30–60 min   | $300–$1,000          | Simple ETL, scheduled reports                 |
| **Event-Driven**  | ≤ 500 ms    | $200–$1,000          | Responsive apps, loosely coupled workflows    |
| **Streaming**     | ≤ 1 sec     | $1,000–$2,500        | Real-time metrics, ML inference, dashboards   |
