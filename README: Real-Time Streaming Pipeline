**Real-Time Streaming Pipeline: Recommendations, Fraud Scoring & Live Dashboards**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

To enhance customer experience and mitigate risk, the platform ingests user interactions and transaction events in real time, powering **personalized recommendations**, **fraud detection**, and **live operational dashboards**. This white-paper README outlines the high-level design, non-functional requirements, technology trade-offs, performance and cost estimates, monitoring strategy, and future roadmap—tailored for AI Product Management stakeholders.

## 2. Architecture Overview

![Real-Time Streaming Architecture](./diagrams/realtime_streaming_architecture.png)

* **Data Ingestion:** User events (clicks, views, purchases) → Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
* **Processing & Enrichment:** AWS Lambda Functions subscribe to Kinesis shards, enrich events with user metadata and feature calculations
* **Stream Bus:** Apache Kafka (MSK) replicates enriched events for downstream consumers
* **Stateful Storage:** Apache Druid ingests batches from Kafka for OLAP queries and time-series analytics
* **Consumers:**

  1. **Recommendation Engine** subscribes to Kafka topic for near-immediate model updates
  2. **Fraud Scoring Service** applies ML models via Lambda on high-value transactions
  3. **Live Dashboards** (e.g., Superset or custom UI) query Druid for real-time metrics

## 3. Key Requirements & SLAs

| Requirement               | Target                                       |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Throughput**            | 50,000 events/sec                            |
| **Enrichment Latency**    | ≤ 200 ms per event                           |
| **End-to-End Latency**    | ≤ 1 sec (Kinesis → Dashboard update)         |
| **Query Concurrency**     | 200 concurrent dashboard queries             |
| **Availability**          | 99.99% uptime                                |
| **Cost Envelope**         | ≤ \$2,500/month AWS + MSK & Druid costs      |
| **Failure Tolerance**     | At-least-once delivery; DLQs for errors      |
| **Security & Compliance** | Encryption in motion & at rest; IAM policies |

## 4. Trade-off Analysis

| Component            | Option A             | Option B                       | Decision & Rationale                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stream Ingestion** | Kinesis Data Streams | Kafka (MSK)                    | **Kinesis chosen**<br>Fully managed, auto-scaling, seamless AWS integration; MSK added later for cross-region replication and specialized use cases.  |
| **Processing Layer** | AWS Lambda           | Kinesis Data Analytics / Flink | **Lambda chosen**<br>Serverless simplicity for feature enrichment at scale; KDA evaluated for complex stateful computations in next phase.            |
| **Message Bus**      | MSK (Kafka)          | Kinesis Data Firehose          | **MSK chosen**<br>Enables durable pub/sub for multiple consumers, partitioning control, and ecosystem integrations (e.g. Druid ingestion connectors). |
| **Analytics Store**  | Apache Druid         | Redshift / Snowflake           | **Druid chosen**<br>Sub-second OLAP queries on high-cardinality time-series data, optimized for live dashboards and ad-hoc slice-and-dice.            |

## 5. End-to-End Latency & Cost Estimate

* **Kinesis ingestion:** \~50 ms
* **Lambda enrichment:** \~150 ms
* **Kafka replication:** \~50 ms
* **Druid ingestion & indexing:** \~500 ms (approx. per batch)
* **Dashboard query:** \~200 ms

**Total pipeline latency:** \~950 ms

**Monthly Spend Estimate:**

* Kinesis Data Streams (5 shards): \~\$300
* Lambda invocations (100M/month): \~\$400
* MSK cluster (3 brokers): \~\$600
* Druid cluster (m5.large x3): \~\$800
* Data transfer & storage: \~\$200

> **Total:** \~\$2,300/month *(scales with shard count and cluster sizing)*

## 6. Monitoring & Alerts

* **Metrics:** CloudWatch for Kinesis, Lambda metrics; MSK JMX metrics; Druid metrics for ingestion and query latencies
* **Logs:** Centralized in CloudWatch Logs and Elasticsearch for advanced tracing
* **Alerts:** SNS notifications on:

  * Lambda error rates >1%
  * Kinesis iterator age >1 min
  * MSK under-replicated partitions >0
  * Druid ingestion or query failures

## 7. Next Steps & Roadmap

1. **Stateful Stream Processing:** Evaluate Apache Flink or Kinesis Data Analytics for windowed aggregations (e.g., sessionization).
2. **Feature Store Integration:** Publish enriched features to a feature store (e.g., SageMaker Feature Store) for unified model training and inference.
3. **Cross-Region Replication:** Enhance resiliency and global consistency by replicating streams via MSK MirrorMaker or Global Kinesis.
4. **Cost Optimization:** Implement adaptive shard scaling on Kinesis and auto-scaling for MSK & Druid clusters.
5. **Enhanced Security:** Integrate KMS-managed keys for encryption at rest and enforce VPC-only access for all components.
